# AppStoreVersionChecker
## Introduction

Welcome to the **AppStoreVersionChecker** project!

### Overview
The AppStoreVersionChecker is a Python script designed to retrieve the current running version of an application on the Apple App Store. This script aims to simplify the process of obtaining the latest version information of an application by automating the retrieval from the App Store website.

### Benefits
Using the AppStoreVersionChecker script provides several benefits:
- **Convenience**: Instead of manually visiting the App Store website and searching for the application's version, this script automates the process, saving time and effort.
- **Automation**: The script fetches the application version by searching for a specific HTML element in the App Store webpage's response. It eliminates the need for manual inspection or data extraction.
- **Integration**: The script can be easily integrated into other projects or workflows, allowing developers to programmatically retrieve the current version information for their applications.

### Prerequisites and Dependencies

- **Python**: The script requires Python 3.x to run. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Requests Library**: The script uses the `requests` library to send HTTP requests to the Play Store website. You can install it using `pip` with the following command: `pip install requests`
- **Beautiful Soup**: The script utilizes the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse and extract data from HTML content. Install it using `pip` with the following command: `pip install beautifulsoup4`
