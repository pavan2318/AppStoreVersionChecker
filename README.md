# AppStoreVersionChecker
## Introduction
Welcome to the **AppStoreVersionChecker** project!
### Overview
The AppStoreVersionChecker is a Python script designed to retrieve the current running version of an application on the Apple App Store. This script aims to simplify the process of obtaining the latest version information of an application by automating the retrieval from the App Store website.
### Benefits
Using the AppStoreVersionChecker script provides several benefits:
- **Convenience**: Instead of manually visiting the App Store website and searching for the application's version, this script automates the process, saving time and effort.
- **Automation**: The script fetches the application version by searching for a specific HTML element in the App Store webpage's response. It eliminates the need for manual inspection or data extraction.
- **Integration**: The script can be easily integrated into other projects or workflows, allowing developers to programmatically retrieve the current version information for their applications.
### Prerequisites and Dependencies
Before using the AppStoreVersionChecker script, ensure you have the following prerequisites and dependencies in place:
- **Python**: The script requires Python 3.x to run. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Requests Library**: The script uses the `requests` library to send HTTP requests to the App Store website. You can install it using `pip` with the following command: `pip install requests`
- **Beautiful Soup**: The script utilizes the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse and extract data from HTML content. Install it using `pip` with the following command: `pip install beautifulsoup4`
## Installation
To use the AppStoreVersionChecker script, follow the steps below to install and set up the project.
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the AppStoreVersionChecker repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/pavan2318/AppStoreVersionChecker.git
```
### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Navigate to the project directory by executing the following command:
```
cd AppStoreVersionChecker
```
### Step 3: Install Dependencies
The script relies on the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries. Install them by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 4: Run the Script
You are now ready to run the AppStoreVersionChecker script. Execute the following command:
```
python appstore_version_checker.py
```
The script will prompt you to enter the Apple App Store URL for the application. Once you provide the URL, it will fetch the current running version of the application and display it on the console.
## Usage
To use the AppStoreVersionChecker script, follow the steps below:
### Step 1: Run the Script
Execute the following command to run the AppStoreVersionChecker script:
```
python appstore_version_checker.py
```
### Step 2: Enter the Apple App Store URL
The script will prompt you to enter the Apple App Store URL for the application. Provide the URL as requested. For example:
```
Enter the Apple App Store URL for the application: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/example-app/id123456789
```
### Step 3: Retrieve the Application Version
Once you provide the URL, the script will send a request to the App Store website and retrieve the current running version of the application. It will display the fetched version on the console. For example:
```
Current running version: 1.2.3
```
Congratulations! You have successfully used the AppStoreVersionChecker script to fetch the current running version of an application on the Apple App Store.
## Changelog
### Version 0.1 (2023-07-01)
- Initial release of AppStoreVersionChecker
- Added functionality to retrieve the current running version of an application on the Apple App Store
- Implemented parsing of HTML response to extract version information
- Provided a command-line interface for user interaction
- Supported customization of the App Store URL
## Roadmap
Here are some potential future plans and enhancements for the AppStoreVersionChecker project:
- **Improved Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to provide more descriptive error messages and better handle various scenarios such as network failures or invalid URLs.
- **Command-Line Arguments**: Implement command-line arguments to allow users to specify the App Store URL directly as an argument instead of entering it interactively.
- **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**: Provide examples and documentation on how to integrate the AppStoreVersionChecker script into continuous integration and deployment pipelines for automated version checking.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a graphical user interface for the AppStoreVersionChecker script to provide a more user-friendly and intuitive way of entering the App Store URL and viewing the version information.
- **Support for Multiple App Stores**: Extend the script's functionality to support retrieving version information from other app stores, such as Google Play Store or Microsoft Store.
- **Unit Testing and Test Coverage**: Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the script, and increase the test coverage to cover different scenarios and edge cases.
Please note that the above roadmap is subject to change based on feedback, contributions, and emerging needs. We welcome suggestions and contributions from the community to help shape the future of the AppStoreVersionChecker project.
