## Introduction

Welcome to the **PlayStoreVersionChecker** project!

### Overview
The PlayStoreVersionChecker is a Python script designed to retrieve the current running version of an application on the Apple Play Store. This script aims to simplify the process of obtaining the latest version information of an application by automating the retrieval from the Play Store website.

### Benefits

- **Convenience**: Instead of manually visiting the Play Store website and searching for the application's version, this script automates the process, saving time and effort.
- **Automation**: The script fetches the application version by searching for a specific HTML element in the Play Store webpage's response. It eliminates the need for manual inspection or data extraction.
- **Integration**: The script can be easily integrated into other projects or workflows, allowing developers to programmatically retrieve the current version information for their applications.
